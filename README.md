1. cd into it
1. Run npm install in your terminal
1. Run node index.js in your terminal to start the game

### Preview of App:


### Context:
[//]: <>
This project was the product of 12 hours over the course of 3 days. The project was assigned on the first day of the second section of Turing's Front End Engineering curriculum (about 6 weeks into the program).
 
### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <>
- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### Wins and Challenges:
[//]: <>
This project was, to date, some of the cleanest code I have written. While not perfect, it has far less bulk by use of truthy/falsy statements and methods like beforeEach. This was very satisfying for me because given the time constraints in the program, I felt I had very little time to go back, refactor or even write DRY code up front. I quickly realized in this project, that the code was going smoothly for me because I had written DRY code up front. Lesson learned!!
